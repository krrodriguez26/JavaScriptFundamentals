Project Description: This weeks project is focused on  building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, along with a highscore feature in which the player will be able to to save their highscore.

Requirements:  
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score 

Configuration:  Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to create a multiple choice quiz with a counter on each question. Eveytime the user answers a question correctly the background color of the App will turn green. When a user answers a question incorrectly the screen will turn red.

Quiz questions were taken from W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/result.asp
